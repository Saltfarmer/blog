Hello everyone, long time no writing. The past few days have been quite busy for me. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit too lazy to write, but the main reason I’m posting today is that I need to record a lot of stuff so I can remember it properly.

## Fixing the Code

Let’s start with the usual stuff—though depending on how you see it, it could be quite important. Recently, I’ve been fixing my code and trying to understand how it works. At first, it ran very slowly, and I realized it was because my loops were unnecessarily repetitive. After optimizing the loops, things improved.

However, I encountered another issue when I tried exporting my data to the cloud. Initially, I couldn’t do it because the cloud storage was full. The next day, after clearing some space, I managed to export the data. But then, I stumbled upon yet another issue.

The problem was that my function kept labeling the layers of the transaction network as "1," which made summarizing the data impossible. I only noticed this when I started cleaning the summarized data. Thankfully, I think I fixed this issue this afternoon, but I haven’t had the chance to check the data yet.

In addition, I completed my task of creating an office scoring system and collecting data related to monitoring, fraud detection, YoY savings and loans, and asset-liabilities management. Although this job is only required next month, we still need to determine the appropriate weighting for the scoring and automate the related processes.

## Practicing Apache Superset and Discussion with "The Dudes"

This part is a bit of a love-hate relationship. Apache Superset has great potential as a business analytics tool. It’s free, customizable, and offers a lot of room for tinkering, especially for ex-developers. But on the downside, its visualizations aren’t flexible enough, the dashboard layering is frustrating, and the basic UI design leaves a lot to be desired.

This afternoon, I challenged myself to learn more about Superset by transforming some basic analytics from Tableau into Superset. The learning curve was a bit steep. For example, it’s unclear when the data upload process is complete. You also have to manipulate the data first before creating a visualization, which is called a "chart" in Superset. Once the chart is ready, you then place it in a "dashboard."

Another tricky aspect is that you can’t use the same chart twice in a dashboard, even across multiple tabs. Creating "metrics" in Superset is also confusing. For instance, how do you create a "measure" similar to Power BI in Superset? It’s not intuitive.

After working through these challenges, I managed to complete my task this afternoon. However, in my haste, I sent the example directly to "the dudes" instead of consulting my team leader first. As a result, I received a lot of criticism and misunderstandings about the visualizations. It’s frustrating because the mechanism is identical to Tableau, but I realize it was my mistake for rushing instead of discussing it with my team beforehand.

## Big Responsibilities Incoming

Later in the afternoon, I was assigned as the Person in Charge for a long-term project. My plan is to start by creating a list of indicators related to each typology and then check the glossary for each indicator to understand how to measure potential losses. It sounds straightforward, but I’ll need to keep track of it carefully.

In two days, I’ll also have a User Acceptance Test with the data management division to discuss asset-liabilities management datasets. It’s a big step, and I’m both nervous and excited about the discussions.

## My SO is Sick, and I Keep Thinking About It

Not much to say here. I’m really worried about her health and feel helpless because I can’t do much to help. I’ve been sharing my concerns with her directly, so I’ll keep this section brief.

That’s all for today, folks! Thanks for reading. I’ll catch you in the next post. Stay tuned for more updates, and don’t forget to follow me for more wholesome content!
