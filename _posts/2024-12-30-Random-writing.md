# Long time not writing, lets start

## Introduction

It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post, and I'm excited to start again. With the new year approaching, I want to revive my old habit of writing and share my thoughts with you. In this post, I'll be writing randomly without a structure, so bear with me.

## My Goals for 2025

I've created a list of easy-to-do habits that I want to maintain consistently. These include:

* Attending work and being punctual
* Morning jogs
* Reading a book for at least 30 minutes a day
* Practicing Duolingo for 15 minutes a day
* Writing a blog post daily
* Doing abs exercises to get those elusive six-packs
* Taking care of my skin before bed

I've already completed 4 of these tasks today, and I'm feeling motivated to continue.

## My Resolutions for 2024 and 2025

In 2024, my resolutions were:

* [X] Save $100 million (achieved)
* [ ] Get a girlfriend
* [ ] Earn a double-digit salary per month
* [ ] Get six-packs and weigh around 68 kg with under 20% body fat

For 2025, I've added some new resolutions:

* [ ] Save $100 million (again, because it's a great goal)
* [ ] Get a girlfriend
* [ ] Learn the basics of Rust programming language
* [ ] Learn Dutch or Japanese
* [ ] Get six-packs and weigh around 68 kg with under 20% body fat

## Daily Sharing

I want to share something interesting with you every day. Today, I'll be talking about **Prompt Engineering**.

### What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the process of designing and refining inputs or questions to improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of AI responses. It's like teaching a language model to understand what you want it to say.

### What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is an input or question given to a language model to guide its response output. The goal is to shape the output of the AI model by specifying the information or type of response the user is seeking.

## 5 Common Mistakes in Prompting and How to Fix Them

1. **Vague Direction**: Give the AI clear direction on what you want it to do.
2. **Unformatted Output**: Specify the format you want the AI to use.
3. **Missing Example**: Provide examples to guide the AI's response.
4. **Limited Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the AI's response.
5. **No Task Division**: Divide tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

### Advanced Techniques

* **Few-shot Prompts**: Provide the AI with examples to help it understand the desired response style.
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Encourage the AI to break down its reasoning into steps.
* **Self-Consistency**: Generate multiple outputs and select the most consistent response.
* **Knowledge Generation Prompting**: Prompt the AI to generate relevant background knowledge before answering a question.
* **ReAct**: Combine reasoning with action-oriented responses.

These techniques can help you get the most out of language models like ChatGPT, Llama, and others.

## Conclusion

That's it for today's post. I hope you found it interesting and informative. I'll be back with more content soon. Thanks for reading!
