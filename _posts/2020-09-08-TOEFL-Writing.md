Broadly speaking, you’ll get a TOEFL independent writing question based on one of the following styles:

- Agree/Disagree
- Multiple Choice
- Paired Choice
- “Good Idea”

The most common is the **agree/disagree** style, which is used about 50% of the time. The **multiple choice** and **paired choice styles** are each used about 20% of the time. The “**good idea**” style appears about 10% of the time. Samples of each question type are below. Each sample question includes a complete essay.

Note that the questions aren’t about just *any* topics. Mosts of the time, they are about education, working and lifestyle preferences.

At the bottom of the page you will find some sample integrated TOEFL  essays. I can’t provide the reading and lectures for those, but you  might find the structures used in the essays helpful

## Sample

The reading and the lecture are both about whether monarch butterfly populations are  declining, and whether herbicides should be banned in order to save  them. The author of the reading believes that  herbicides should not be banned. The lecturer casts doubt on the claims made in the article.  She thinks that herbicides pose a serious threat to the butterflies and  should be outlawed.

​     First of all, the author claims that no overall decline in monarch butterfly  populations has been observed in North America. He notes that  populations in certain areas have dropped, but that these have been  offset by gains in other locations. This point is challenged by the  lecturer. She says because the butterflies are extremely territorial, it is very easy for biologists to count them. Furthermore, she points out that a very clear drop in monarch butterfly populations has, in fact,  been measured.

​     Secondly, the author states that herbicides kill the milkweed that butterflies  consume, but that plenty of it still remains in the wild for them to  feed on. He argues that herbicides have not caused a general decline in milkweed availability, but just a decline on commercial farmland. This argument is rebutted by the lecturer. She suggests that it is a  well-known fact that America is rapidly losing rural land because of  urban sprawl. She notes that this effect has led to a very real decline of milkweed availability in rural areas.

​     Finally, the author mentions that the attempt to ban herbicides is based on  emotion rather than evidence and research. He is of the opinion that  people only want to ban the herbicides because they affect the food of  their beloved butterflies. The lecturer, on the other hand, feels that  the move to ban herbicides is based on a rational examination of the  evidence available. She puts forth the idea that we know the herbicides affect milkweed and  we know that butterflies consume milkweed, so we  can logically assume that the herbicides are detrimental to the insects.

## Sample

​	The world is  changing at a rapid pace nowadays due to the actions of human  populations. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will  explore in the following essay.

​     To begin with, industrial development has caused major air pollution,  which has a terrible effect on our health.  Every week we can hear news  reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the  world. Additionally, it is often reported that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is a connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, which is home to  many massive factories. After having spent most of my life living in the Canadian countryside where the air is mostly clean, I immediately  noticed the smog and pollution of urban China.  Within months I began  suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty  breathing. As a result, I spent quite a few afternoons at a local  hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections. A  majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities, and they  often suffer from similar consequences of industrial development.

​     Secondly, human development has led to a massive accumulation of trash, which spoils the natural beauty of the planet.  While in the past  products were often made of biodegradable materials like paper and wood, today most manufactured goods are made of plastic that never breaks  down.  Such materials sometimes find their way into permanent landfills, but often they just end up as litter. When I traveled to the island of  Borneo last summer I was impressed by the beauty of the place, but I  also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation  of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere.  Had I  visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in  such a way.

​    In conclusion, I strongly believe that human activity has made the  planet a less pleasant place to live.  This is because people are more  likely to suffer from the effects of pollution than in the past, and  because humans create garbage which has destroyed the natural beauty of  our world.
