Well, this post going to be my finaly year in the Netherlands. A bit of drama here and there but let;s see what happens.

## Winter break
The break is quite nice. The new project is going well. I only need to update the data, adjust requests from the client. Well I've spent my break hangout with my friends that stay in the Netherland and just walk around the central park of Utrecht. I also got invited to Christmas dinner and the first time trying very tasty steak (Although Im not quite sure is it halal or not). The steak is insanely tender and I will remember it until today.

Also, everyone got Champagne (Moet&Chandon brandon). The thing is I have very dilematic position because, well ... I'm Moslem and can't drink but on the other hands I cant refuse the gift from my boss and he kind of insisted. Moving on I am back to working in January and February and get very good news that my boss wanted to extend my contract give me a raise.

I also hangout with my friend in Amsterdam and catching up and say "whats up". But the horrible things happen. My secondhand electric bike got stolen. I felt devastated and insanely mad. I make a report to the police and they dont do shit. I guess it happens everywhere from any place in the world. I dont know, I always got disappointed by the police most of the time.

## Moving on the new place
Well this is more bad news. I dont really like sudden change. After a few dramas previously inside the house (I cant say my house because I only rent the room), unfortunately we need to move away from the house. Well a bit sudden because we've got no connection and it is kind of difficult to find a housing in the Netherlands. Well I guess I kind of lucky that I found the new places. They also quite nice too not really stingy.

Another problem arise, so how do I move my stuff on the new place. So here we can borrow some kind of random tricycle bike (like becak I guess) for few euros. But still is not as easy as I thought before.

## Not extending anymore
Honestly it is kind of difficult to talk about it right now because I wanted to forgot about it. Let me think. So to put it simply my project got extended too long, my boss doesnt wanted to take risk and give me fulltime contracts (understandably so), and no news at all from IND regarding Visa request/response.

So yeah I look for new job both in Indonesia and The Netherlands and here I am working in Banking. So that the end of my story. Still a lot of journey in the future. And all of you the readers who read this, please enjoy your time and be happy. I hope you get all your wishes in 2024
