# TOEFL Speaking Question 1 (Opinion about something)

TOEFL Speaking question 1 is the independent TOEFL speaking question. It is also called the “personal choice” question. Currently, this question will be written in one of three main styles:

- Agree/Disagree
- Paired Choice
- Good Idea

When you take the test you will get just **one** of these styles. You will be given 15 seconds to prepare your answer, and 45 seconds to speak.

Note that the “multiple choice” and “advantages/disadvantages” questions are not used nowadays.

## Example

> Many people think that students learn course materials more effectively by taking exams, while others think that students learn more effectively by doing other activities, like completing projects, which one do you think is more effective?

Answer Script :

Well, I’d have to say that I feel students learn better by doing other activities than taking exams.

For one, when I was a student, any time there was an exam coming up, I would cram. The day or two before test day, I would shove as much information into my short-term memory as possible, and then, after the exam, I would forget everything.

Another reason for this opinion is that students learn in all sorts of ways, not just from taking tests. By doing other activities, like projects, students with alternative learning styles have a better chance of retaining the course materials. These are the reasons why I think students learn more effectively through other activities rather than exams.

## Template

 **Main Point (pick one)**

- “I agree with the idea that…”
- “I think it is better to…”
- “I think it is a great/terrible idea to…”

**Transition (optional)**

- “I feel this way for several reasons.”

**First Reason**

- “First…” + “For example…” (and a personal example)

**Second Reason**

- “Second…” + “To be more specific…” (and a few more details)

## Tips and Tricks

- Avoid Repeating Words. Vary your vocabulary as much as possible.
- Use discourse phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore” to link ideas.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences.
- Don’t copy from the prompt, especially at the beginning.
- Avoid using idioms. They just lead to trouble.

# TOEFL Speaking Question 2 (Campus Announcement)

Here’s how TOEFL speaking question two works:

- You will read a short campus announcement, an article in a campus newspaper, or a letter published in a campus newspaper.
- It will describe some change that is happening, or it will propose some change. There will be two reasons that explain why the change will be made (or should be made). You will have 45 seconds to read it.
- Next, you will hear two students talk about what you read. One of the students will agree with the change, disagree with the change, or (**rarely**) have a mixed opinion. 
- He/she will give two reasons for their support or opposition. These reasons will address the reasons for the change mentioned in the reading.
- After hearing the conversation, you will be asked to summarize what you have read and listened to. You will have 30 seconds to prepare your answer, and 60 seconds to speak.

Note that this is the same as question three on the *old version* of the TOEFL.

## The Reading

The reading part is about 100 words long, and you are given 45 seconds to read it and take notes. 

The changes are usually related to:

- Buildings on a university campus
- Classes and majors at a university
- Transportation on a university campus
- Extra-Curricular activities at a university (sports, clubs, etc)

## **The Listening**

The conversation is 1.5 to 2 minutes long. It is always between a man and a woman. 

##  Example

> ***Increase Library Staff\***
>
> *The library is in desperate need of more staff. The librarians are so overworked and exhausted. They have to run around tired trying to help students, and everyone ends up waiting an extremely long time. The library gets backed-up and no one wins. Even though there are some student workers, they are not much use. They don’t know what they’re doing, so the librarians have to do all the work. The school should hire some more professional librarians to assist our busy and crowded library as soon as possible. Remember everyone, finals are just around the corner, and we need a functioning library before then!*
>
> *Sincerely,*
> *Tamara Schull*

> Now listen to two students discussing the letters
>
> [audio](clyp.it/wzrhstgf?token=f16460b30953f5767d5cc8df40d29868)
>
> **Now answer the question.**
>
> *The man expresses his opinion on the increase in library staff. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.*

Answer Script :

> To be filled later

## Template

**Reading Main Point**

- “According to the announcement/article/letter…”

**Reasons from Reading**

- “This is because ___ and ___.”

**Transition**

- “The man/woman does not support this change.”
- “The man/woman supports this change”
- “The man/woman has a mixed opinion of this change.”

**First Reason**

- “To begin with, he/she points out that…”

**Second Reason**

- “Moreover, he/she argues that…”

## Tips and Tricks

- Link ideas by using discourse phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore.”
- Spend about 10-13 seconds talking about the reading… at most. Remember that most of your score is based on the listening part.
- If you are a slow speaker, don’t mention the reasons for the change.
- Create compound sentences using conjunctions.

# TOEFL Speaking Question 3 (Lecture)

Here’s how TOEFL speaking question 3 works:

- First, you will read a short (100 words) article on an academic topic. You will have 45 seconds to read it.
- Next, you will hear a short lecture about the same topic. The lecture will illustrate it using either one or two examples. 
- Finally, you will be asked to summarize the reading and lecture.
- You will be given 30 seconds to prepare, and 60 seconds to speak.

Note that this is the same as question four on the *old version* of the TOEFL.

## The Reading

The reading is usually about a **specific** term or concept. It usually has a clear title and about five sentences that define the term and give some basic details. When I surveyed 500 students in 2019, they said the most common topics were:

- Biology/Animals – 60%
- Business/Marketing – 20%
- Psychology/Learning – 10%
- Art/History/Literature – 10%

## **The Listening**

The lecture is usually 1.5 minutes or 2 minutes long. It is about the same term or idea from the reading. Most of it will consist of one or two examples that demonstrate the term or idea. It could be an example from the personal life of the speaker. If there is just one example, listen for two parts (like cause/effect or before/after).

## Example

> ***Scarcity Marketing\***
>
> *One of the principal aims of marketing is to figure out what drives consumers to buy products. Some people buy items because everyone else has one. Others buy goods that are rare and they want to be one of the few people to own it. The latter is an example of scarcity marketing. For nearly a century, advertisers have been aware of the positive effect that scarcity marketing has on sales. For example, expressions like, “one of a kind,” or “only a few left in stock,” attracts and encourages consumers to purchase larger quantities at higher prices.*

> **Now listen to a lecture about this topic in a marketing class:**
>
> [audio](clyp.it/igkmflgo)
>
> **Now answer the question.**
>
> *Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of scarcity marketing.*

Answer script :

> to be filled

## Template

**Stating the Term or Idea**

- “The reading is about (TERM/CONCEPT)”

**Give a Small Amount of Detail from the Reading**

- “It states that…”

**Transition**

- “The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.”
- “The professor elaborates on this by providing two examples.”

**First Example/First Part**

- “To begin with, he/she mentions that…”

**Second Example/Second Part**

- “Next, he/she says that…”

## Tips and tricks

- Try to use transitional phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore.”
- Spend about 10-13 seconds summarizing the reading… at most. Remember that most of your score is based on the listening summary.
- If you are a slow speaker, omit the “small amount of detail” part of the template.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences if possible.
- Paraphrase. Don’t just copy the sources word for word.

# TOEFL Speaking Question 3 (Lecture Audio Only)

Here’s how TOEFL speaking question 4 works:

- First, you will listen to a lecture that is 1.5 to 2 minutes long. It will be about some academic term, concept or process.
- After it finishes, you will be asked a specific question that requires you to mostly summarize the lecture.
- You will be given 20 seconds to prepare, and 60 seconds to speak.

Note that this is the same as question six on the *old version* of the TOEFL.

## **The Listening**

The lecture is usually 1.5 minutes or 2 minutes long. It will be about an academic term, concept, process. This term will likely be illustrated using two examples. In some cases it could be illustrated using one example with two clear parts (before/after, cause/effect, etc). 

The lecture starts with a short introduction that states and defines the subject (3-5 sentences). After the introduction the example(s) are given.

A survey of 600 students in October 2019 suggests the most common topics in TOEFL speaking question 4 are:

- Biology/Animals – 60%
- Business/Marketing – 17%
- Psychology/Learning – 17%
- Art/History/Literature – 6%

## Example

> **Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class**
>
> [audio](clyp.it/yomxupyu)
>
> **Now answer the question**
>
> *Using the example of the cuckoo bird from the lecture, explain two ways in which egg mimicry is beneficial for birds.*

## Template

**Stating the Lecture Subject and detail**

- “The lecturer explains SUBJECT/TERM by giving two examples/an example.”

**First Example/First Part (3-5 sentences)**

- “First, she/he describes…”

**Second Example/Second part (3-5 sentences)**

- “Second, she mentions…”

**Give a Short Conclusion**

- “These examples (this example) demonstrate…”

## Tips and Tricks

- Try to use transitional phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” “for example” and “therefore.”
- Focus mostly on the examples. Those should be about 50 seconds long.
- If you are a slow speaker, omit the conclusion.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences if possible.
- Your conclusion should be a bit more detailed than your introduction
