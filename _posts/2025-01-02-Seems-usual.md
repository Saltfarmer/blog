Good evening, Another day, another chance to write for the sake of building habits. It’s starting to feel fun, not gonna lie. The thing is, I need a single reader—just one—to hold me accountable for writing regularly. But I’m unsure where to share my writing without feeling judged. Recently, I’ve been wanting to write about my daily life.

## Grateful for Good Habits

Today, nothing much happened, but I’m very grateful to have continued my streak of good habits. However, I’ve decided to drop Duolingo. The app’s five-mistakes-and-you’re-out system is really inconvenient. I’ve also adjusted my ab exercise routine (actually started yesterday) to include more passive movements like planks. Funny enough, I can only manage two sets before yawning.

## Lunch with Coworkers

Something different today: we had lunch together as a department. This time, it was at a Padang restaurant. While Padang food is nice, it wasn’t as special as our last lunch outing at a steakhouse.

The high-calorie Padang dishes left me feeling sleepy in the afternoon, making it hard to focus at work. I didn’t accomplish anything meaningful today, and that guilt is weighing on me a bit.

## Meeting Someone New Online

So, I introduced myself to a girl on r/indor4r. Given my past experiences with romance, I’m keeping my expectations as low as possible. This afternoon, she replied to my message and asked some random questions about hobbies. She mentioned being extroverted, which is great—I appreciate someone who can carry the conversation without me having to initiate all the time.

After my last experience, where I felt drained from maintaining conversations as an introvert, this feels refreshing. Fingers crossed, though I’m trying not to expect too much.

## Collecting Photos

I’ve been thinking about backing up some old photos for dating app profiles. It still makes me nervous knowing my pictures will be judged. I remember a time when a female coworker was mocking guys’ dating app profiles while trying to set up her friends. Honestly, it annoyed me. It felt disrespectful toward people genuinely putting themselves out there.

I’ve been mad at her in the past, but I’ve decided to take the high road and not confront her about it. I just hope she becomes more sensitive because this isn’t the first time she’s been inconsiderate.

## Tomorrow: Fun Friday

Nothing else to add for now. Tomorrow is Fun Friday—time for interesting articles, random posts, or just more thoughts to share.

# What Are This or That Questions?

This or that questions are a type of icebreaker where participants choose between two options, also known as “either-or questions.” Examples include:

* Cats or dogs?
* Chocolate or vanilla?
* Night or morning?
* Messy or tidy?
* Cash or credit?

These questions differ from “Would you rather” because they focus on objects instead of scenarios. They demand quick answers but can spark engaging, funny discussions revealing inner logic and psychology. These prompts are also called “a-or-b questions” or “make me choose between two things.”

## How to Ask This or That Questions

There are many ways to ask this or that questions:

* Video call polls
* Team-building emails
* Casual discussions
* Icebreakers at events or meetings
* Social media posts

For larger groups, you can ask participants to physically move to one side of the room instead of answering individually.

## Funny This or That Questions

Here are some funny examples:

* Zombies or vampires?
* Bad breath or body odor?
* Working hard or hardly working?
* Speeding ticket or parking ticket?

Tailor the humor to suit your audience, choosing more risque or clean jokes as needed.

## Hard This or That Questions

For a deeper discussion, try these thought-provoking options:

* Logic or emotion?
* Predictability or excitement?
* Money or love?
* Success or happiness?
* Painful truth or comforting lie?
* Pause time or rewind time?

These questions inspire insightful responses and reveal core beliefs and values.
