## Data Imputation

Data imputation entails replacing missing or null values with estimated values to maintain data integrity.

## Data Standardization

Standardizing data involves putting all data into a common format to facilitate comparison and analysis.

## Data Transformation

Data transformation involves modifying existing data to make it more suitable for analysis or modeling.

## Outlier Detection

## Data Validation

Data validation aims to check if data adheres to defined rules and constraints, identifying and correcting inconsistencies.

## Data Encoding

Data encoding involves converting categorical data into a numerical format to make it compatible with machine learning algorithms.

## Data Aggregation

Data aggregation entails grouping data by category, time period, or another criterion to obtain summarized statistics.

## Data Sampling
