# Happy New Year from My Bedroom!

So happy new year everyone (like if there is anyone going to read my blog anyway). Eventhough I am celebrating the new years eve in my bedroom, somehow this is the best new year I've ever had. The biggest reason is last night is the most quiet new years and I have very good quality sleep.

Back then there is always festivities (not that I hate all of them), loud sounds, the noise, etc. Also in the morning I quite motivated to run in the morning. Not really early tho because somehow I got hooked to watch some anime. Fortunately enough I finish the season of anime Oshi No Ko. The quality still good and it still enjoyable. Unlike Blue Lock with powerpoint animation LOL.

## The thing that I planned to do today

### Running In the morning

This morning, I woke up feeling motivated to tackle my day. I went for a run, albeit a shorter one than I had planned, due to the unpredictable weather. But hey, 3 laps are better than none, right? After my run, I spent some time doing laundry (because, adulting) and fixing my blog (which was long overdue).

### Do laundry

I prefer to do laundry in the weekend I guess because I am too lazy to change the bedsheets. Funny story is I spill my Caramel Machiatto on top of my bed. Maybe there is a divine message that i need to clean my bedsheet immediately.

### Fixing blog

This one is easier, just took a little bit of time

### Create video intro and outro

I also had some fun creating a video intro and outro for my YouTube project using Canva. It's amazing how many templates they have, and it was a breeze to set up my branding and add some music effects from myinstant.com (which, by the way, has an awesome collection of meme sounds).

## Addicted to book again

So in the past few days, continuing the habit to read the book at least for 30 minutes is easy. I even read the book for 1 and half hour. I wanted to read it again but I need to hold myself because I need time to do the other habits such as writing, facecare, and abs exercise.

The book is **the beginning after the end**.  **The Beginning After the End** is a popular light novel series written by TurtleMe, blending elements of fantasy, action, and comedy. The story follows **King Grey**, a powerful ruler who possesses immense strength, wealth, and prestige in a world dominated by martial prowess. Despite his power, he experiences profound loneliness and a lack of purpose.

After being betrayed and killed by someone close to him, Grey is reincarnated as **Arthur Leywin**, a newborn in a magical world filled with monsters and adventure. Retaining the memories of his past life, Arthur embarks on a journey to discover his new abilities and navigate the complexities of this unfamiliar realm. His early years are marked by training in magic and combat, guided by his parents—his father being a warrior and his mother a mage.

The series has garnered significant attention for its intricate plot, character development, and exploration of a complex power system involving Aether. It also delves into family dynamics and political intrigue within the magical society Arthur inhabits.

## Random deep thought

So while I am chilling and reading, It's been in my mind for some reason my departement head doesnt include my pics in a collage of pictures of the department. I know that I should not care about because its probably just a small mistake. But somehow it reminds me that you are nothing and forgetable in the mind of the bigger boss. In fact I never have casual chat with my department head. I dont know it just he putting some boundaries. Strangely enough, he is quite chill towards other member. ONLY on the new kids including me that he never converse with. Hope its not going to be a problem in miscomunication in the future considering my company is quite big.

Also I did remember that this is the early months. I am probably to need to prepare the monthly report as usual.  We might have the department group lunch/dinner tomorrow.

## Considering Dating Apps

Now maybe I give my chance to look for someone. I wanted to try dating apps, but it scares me a little bit because woman can be very cruel and has high expectation. Maybe I should not think too much about it and relies on AI assistant to create profile. Also I need to collect and enhance my 5-6 best images I ever had. The apps itself is CMWB and Bumble. Wish me luck and I hope i find the one.

As usual I wanted to share some content including my personal comment.
