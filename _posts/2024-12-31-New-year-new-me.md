Well hello again, it's me the usual salty guys that start to write again. Today I wanted to share that I finish "good habit" in 2 days in a row LOL. Basically my habit that i need to track is

* Absent
* Morning Jog
* Drink Vitamin
* Abs exercise
* Duolingo
* Reading for at least 30 minutes
* Facecare

The only stuff that I havent do it yet is doing facecare because i usually do it before i sleep. About the Duolingo tho, I'd like to learn new language but Duolingo isnt kind of fun because 5 mistakes and you are out. It's more like bragging game instead of studying tools so far I've felt like. So I might change those habits. However I felt like reading is getting easier because I got the part where i got hooked when I am reading novels.

## New year but nothing special 

Funny thing is I discuss it with my coworker why we should celebrate new year? Isnt it just another day in our life? I mean compared to lets say Independence day or Eid, there is no like historical enjoyment about new year compared to other holiday. Maybe my writing assistant can explain it better hahaha.

So I have plan for new year actually, first thing first I would like to do morning run a little bit later at Gelora Bung Karno. Maybe 4-5 laps and force myself till im tired. I also conside i should bring my bagpack to run so I can bring my iPad to read a book in a cafe. But now I am thinking about it its really inconvenience.

## Thing I might to do or need to do

* [ ] Run in GBK in the morning tomorrow
* [ ] Laundry
* [ ] Fixing my blog
* [ ] Creating a video intro and outro for my Youtube project

I guess thats my plan for tomorrow. Of course I wont forget my habit. Now time to share about cobalt.tools, quiet useful site and FREE.
