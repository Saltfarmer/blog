# Back on Track: 2 Days of Good Habits and Counting!

Hey there, it's your favorite salty guy here, and I'm thrilled to share that I've managed to stick to my good habits for two days in a row! I know, I know, it's not a record-breaking achievement, but hey, it's a start, right?

So, what are these habits I'm trying to cultivate? Well, I've got a list:

* Being present and accounted for (no absent days!)
* Morning jogs to get the blood pumping
* Drinking vitamins to keep the engine running
* Abs exercises to get those coveted six-packs
* Learning a new language with Duolingo (more on this later)
* Reading for at least 30 minutes a day to escape reality
* Facecare before bed to keep the skin looking fresh

The only habit I haven't quite nailed yet is facecare, but that's because I usually do it right before bed. No biggie!

Now, about Duolingo... I'm not sure if it's just me, but I find it more like a bragging game than a studying tool. I mean, five mistakes and you're out? That's not exactly the most encouraging way to learn a new language. Maybe I'll have to explore other options or find ways to make it more enjoyable.

On a more positive note, I've been getting into reading again, and it's been a game-changer! I've found myself getting hooked on novels, and it's amazing how much more enjoyable it is when you're invested in the story.

## The New Year: Just Another Day?

I had an interesting conversation with a coworker the other day about why we celebrate the new year. Is it really that special? I mean, compared to holidays like Independence Day or Eid, there doesn't seem to be much historical significance to it. Maybe my writing assistant can shed some light on this (hint, hint!).

## Plans for the New Year

Despite my skepticism about the new year, I do have some plans to make the most of it. Tomorrow, I'm aiming to go for a morning run at Gelora Bung Karno, maybe 4-5 laps, and push myself until I'm tired. I'm also thinking of bringing my backpack with my iPad so I can read a book in a cafe afterward. However, the more I think about it, the more I realize it might be a bit of a hassle.

## To-Do List

Here are some things I need to tackle tomorrow:

* [ ] Go for a morning run at GBK
* [ ] Do laundry (because, adulting)
* [ ] Fix my blog (it's been a while!)
* [ ] Create a video intro and outro for my YouTube project (exciting times ahead!)

Of course, I won't forget about my daily habits. Now, let's talk about something cool – cobalt.tools! It's a super useful site, and the best part? It's free!
