PLEASE DONT READ THIS !!!! ITS BORING

Good evening, sorry no post on weekend. A little bit too busy with some stuff. In fact I am trying to post on Sunday but I guess I got a little bit too tired from all of that including the traveling from Jakarta to Depok and vice versa.

## My Online dating story

Holy molly, I didnt expect it is going smoothly. In fact I dont expect that I found cute and hot girl only by one day activating my account. Maybe it lust or something but damn, everything about her is nice. Maybe I am just so so lucky because its on weekend or my profile is going to work.

However there is a little bit problems. I dont wanted to sounds like I am bragging or overconfident or something but its kinda difficult to maintain conversation with multiple people at once. I even kinda hard to focus or to think on what i am going to talk about. It stressed me out a little bit.

Honestly tho, I do feel bad because it feels like cheating eventhough its only based on chat. I dont know, I need someone to consult about this. It just too much for me if I have to say "I like someone else better, are you fine just being friend?". Because I really know how it feels to be friendzoned with unclear reason.

## About books . . .

I got a new book reference such as i want to die but i want to eat topokki 1&2, loving the wounded soul, the essential of rumi, zen wisdom of anxious, power robbert greene. I also did read a new book from Nicollo Machiavelli such as the prince and How to rule (idk its in Indonesian).

NOW RANDOM SHARING TIME !!!!
