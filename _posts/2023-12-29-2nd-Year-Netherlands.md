A long break between the previous post. I've been busy with my new job (more like training) recently so yeah I might update this blog a little bit next year but more on a personal level. So in this post, I will continue my experience in my 2nd year in the Netherlands.

## Final Theses

Well, to be honest, I am not really that proud of my achievements. After so many struggles in the previous classes (I honestly don't really remember anything) I felt like I had really low confidence in myself. Also for some reason so many empty times I'm not really sure how I manage myself. Moving on to the final quarter we need to make a thesis for 3 freaking months. The most difficult part is somehow we only have a meeting with our mentor/supervisor biweekly and it's started on week 3. I have so much anxiety about this because I am not really used to creating a thesis without any base with only 3 months (even less because it is technically 10 weeks).

Last week I finally completed my thesis and I got compliments from my colleagues. However I don't know what I am missing in my research, I've got really average grades. Not that I'm complaining but it is just so strange as a technical person like myself, I've got a mentor in social studies and however the other judges from the technical part asked for statistical tests which I only got on my presentation days. Well, at least I am finally graduated and moving on to a new chapter of my life a Master of Applied Data Science.

## Looking for jobs

After I finished my thesis, deep down I had small regrets about not attending my own graduation ceremony. Most of my friends are International students so they can't attend because the ceremony is in December if I recall. From LinkedIn, I tried to apply for every possible job related to Data Analyst or Data Scientist. After so many struggles and desperation in looking for jobs and experience, finally, I've got my first job ever in In2Intel. Full appreciation for Mark van Lest, Job Folkers, and Karim Chouaten for the opportunity. I've learned so much stuff here regarding data engineering, PowerBI, Azure, etc. In2Academy is a really underrated and insanely good program. I hope they are continuing with this.

In In2intel, especially in 2022, I've got a small test on doing tasks on SQL related to hotels. But I think I fail on most of the tasks and I'm not good enough. So they assign me to a different project on gathering data from social media LinkedIn. I think I kind of lucky with this even though I made a small mistake that made my account get flagged for scraping aggressively. However, my company and my client are satisfied with my presentation on the data and dashboard showing the cardiologist in the Netherlands. At this point, I feel like I've got to have a career abroad.
