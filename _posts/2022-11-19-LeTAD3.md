From [here](https://www.dota2.com/esports/ti11/about), is published that there are some changes of DPC. In summary, the changes was :

## Added text under " Who owns a team slot? "

>  " The registered admin is the sole owner of the team and can kick any/all members of the team. If a team does not wish to have a single admin, or if they wish to have an admin with limited control, a team may set up contracts among themselves and we will respect contracts in case of separation. "

## Added text under "Can a team get acquired by an organization or a different organization?"

> " Contact a tournament organizer for details. "

## Changed text under " Can a team play with subs? "

### Was:

> " Any team that competes in a Major tournament with a sub will incur a 40% penalty on DPC Points earned from that tournament. "

### New:

> " Any team that competes in a Major tournament with a sub will incur a 40% penalty per sub (up to 2 subs) on DPC Points earned from that tournament. If more than 2 subs are required for a team, that team will be considered forfeited. "

## Changed text under "Can we make roster changes when they're not locked?"

### Was:

> " Yes - though any player removals will incur a 15% penalty to all DPC Point earned at the time of removal. There is no penalty for adding a new player. "

### New:

> " Yes - though any player removals will incur a 20% penalty to all DPC Points earned at the time of removal. Any partial DPC points will be rounded down for each individual event. There is no penalty for adding a new player. "

## Changed text under " Who can remove a player from a team? "

### Was:

> " The manager of a team can remove any player from their team, and any player can remove themselves from a team while a roster lock isn't in place. Doing so will incur a penalty to the team of 15% of all DPC points earned up to that point in the Season including the points to be earned in the League currently being played. "

### New:

> " The manager of a team can remove any player from their team, and any player can remove themselves from a team while a roster lock isn't in place. Doing so will incur a penalty to the team of 20% of all DPC points earned up to that point in the Season including the points to be earned in the League currently being played. "

# Where is the next Major going to be ?

According to [rumour](https://escorenews.com/en/dota-2/news/40268-sources-first-dota-2-major-of-next-season-will-be-held-in-lima-peru), the next major will be in Lima, Bali and Berlin. This is really exciting news especially for me as an Indonesian to have a Major tournament country. I am hoping that is not going to be as a shitshow like in GESC Minor (A lot of player still not getting paid). For a major tournament in South America, [I kind of call it from Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/xxrnjz/comment/irdrrg6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I mean it is really make sense because after the rise of South American teams in the tournament and CSGO Rio Major in Brazil.

>> I hope you are enjoyed reading quick summary about the next seasons of DPC. I personally cant wait for the roster changes about some team. Let me know in the comments that if you like informative contents about Dota 2. I personally think this kind of post as a archiving interesting news about Dota and the rewrite from my own perspective.
